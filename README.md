# The Opportunity Cost of Reduced Capital Markets Participation
This repository makes available the scripts built for a short analysis of the missed potential gains from low capital markets participation in Portugal. 

This analysis had no specific support or funding. 

### About:
<p align="justify">In these files, you will find some data wrangling, transformation, simple computation and visualization using R.

Data Sources: [Bank of Portugal](https://bpstat.bportugal.pt/conteudos/quadros/655) and [YCharts](https://ycharts.com/indices/%5EMSWNTRL).
The short paper will be available soon. </p> 

### Running Instructions:

```
